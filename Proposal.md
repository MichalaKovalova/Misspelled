# Rust Thicc 2D

## Michala Kovaľová, Martin Gašparík, Andrei Vlad Danilov

The main purpose of this project is to create a safe and secure, general purpose, 2D game engine. The game engine will be designed with simplicity in mind, aiming to offer 

**Introduction**

Rustic2D aims to solve the problem of game development complexity by providing a minimalist, beginner-friendly 2D game engine written in Rust. While many existing game engines offer extensive features, they often come with steep learning curves and unnecessary complexity for simple 2D games. Our engine will focus on core functionality with a clean, well-documented API.

Through this project, we hope to learn:

* Rust's ownership model and memory safety features  
* Entity-component-system (ECS) architecture  
* Game loop implementation and optimization  
* 2D physics and collision detection algorithms  
* Rust's handling of dependencies and crate ecosystem
