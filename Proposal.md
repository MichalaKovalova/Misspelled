# **Rust Thicc 2D**

### Michala Kovaľová, Martin Gašparík, Andrei Vlad Danilov

The main purpose of this project is to create a safe and secure, general purpose, 2D game engine. The game engine will be designed with simplicity   
in mind, aiming to offer basic functionality over complexity. 

## **Through this project, we hope to learn:**

* Rust's ownership model and memory safety features  
* Game loop implementation and optimization  
* 2D physics and collision detection algorithms  
* Rust's handling of dependencies and crate ecosystem

## **Requirements**

* **Core engine**  
  * Window management framework  
  * Entity management  
  * Input handling  
  * File system  
  * Common elements (vector, matrix, color, …)  
* **Audio system**  
* **Physics system**  
  * Collision system  
  * Basic simulations  
* **Graphics system**  
  * Basic rendering  
  * Sprites  
  * Transformations  
  * Camera system  
* **Example game**

## **Dependencies**

* **rapier2d:** 2-dimensional physics engine  
* **nalgebra:** vectors, matrices  
* ?
